OpenBoatUtils
OpenBoatUtils is a client mod that gives server plugins an interface to modify boat physics. If you want to play with modified physics, you can join servers that support OpenBoatUtils (like frosthex.com and mc.boatlabs.net, where certain tracks have modified physics), or you can test the mod with commands in singleplayer.

For plugin developers, the wiki also includes documentation for the packet api.
